Welcome to *@PROJ_NAME@* library,

- a driver for ARM33xx micro processors,
- designed for [Beaglebone hardware](http://www.beaglebone.org), supporting
- analog input and
- digital input and output features.

It's designed for easy configuration and data handling at high speed.
*@PROJ_NAME@* software runs on the host (ARM) and in parallel on a
Programmable Realtime Unit SubSystem (= PRUSS or just PRU) and controls
the CPU subsystems

- Control Module: CPU Ball configurations (pinmuxing)
- GPIO: General Purpose Input / Output
- PWMSS: Pulse-Width Modulation Subsystem (PWM, QEP, CAP)
- TSC_ADC_SS: Touch Screen Controler and Analog-to-Digital Convertor SubSystem (or just ADC)
- TIMER: Timers 4 to 7 (TIMER, PWM)

The driver supports three run modes

- IO mode: digital and analog lines, sloppy timing controlled by the host,
- RB mode: digital and analog lines, accurate ADC timing controlled by the PRU,
- MM mode: analog lines and optional triggers, accurate ADC timing controlled by the PRU.

Since version 0.6.2 a PRU driver is included to load and start firmware
on the PRUSS.

The *@PROJ_NAME@* project is [hosted at GitHub](@PROJ_WEBS@). It's
developed and tested on a Beaglebone Black. It should run on all
Beaglebone platforms with Debian based LINUX operating system,
including PocketBeagle and BeagleboneBlue. It's compiled by the
[FreeBasic compiler](http://www.freebasic.net). Wrappers and examples
code for C and Python programming languages are included.

\note The PRUSS are powerful precessors that can access any memory at
      the host system. There's no kernel protection, the PRU can even
      access kernel space memory. Malware running on a PRU can damage
      your complete system. So be careful which software you run on,
      and enable the PRUSS only when you need them.
