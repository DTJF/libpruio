Description: PRUSS driver for BB A/D-IO
 libpruio is a driver for ARM33xx micro processors, which are used in
 Beaglebone[Black|White|Green|Blue|Pocket-] hardware. Its purpose is to
 provide digital input and output, as well as analog input features.
 It's designed for easy configuration, and data handling at high speed.
 libpruio software runs on the host CPU (ARM), and in parallel on a
 Programmable Realtime Unit SubSystem (= PRUSS or just PRU), and
 controls multiple CPU subsystems, like PWM, eCAP, eQEP, ADC, GPIO,
 TIMERS.  This package contains the executable binaries.

 packaging perfect python bindings. For now, you have to copy the
 example folder to your working directory and execute the code at user
 space. (Proposals for optimization are welcome.)

Description: HTML-documentation for libpruio-dev packages
 libpruio is a hardware driver for
 Beaglebone[Black|White|Green|Blue|Pocket-] hardware, providing
 features like PWM, eCAP, eQEP, ADC, GPIO, Timers. This package
 contains the documentation for using the library (packages
 libpruio-dev or libpruiofb-dev) in your own projects.  The docs
 install as HTML tree, starting at /usr/share/doc/libpruio/index.html.
