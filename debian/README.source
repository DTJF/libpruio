libpruio for Debian
-------------------

Source:

https://github.com/l4m4re/libpruio

Forked from:

http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22501
https://www.freebasic-portal.de/dlfiles/592/libpruio-0.2.tar.bz2

Since the original source did not have Makefiles and there were some
patches around which correct some problems, I made a git repository,
seeded from the original source. All changes to the original source are
documented/recorded in the git repository.
