Licensing

The FreeBASIC compiler (fbc) is licensed under the GNU GPLv2 or later.
The FreeBASIC runtime library (libfb and the thread-safe version, libfbmt)
and the FreeBASIC graphics library (libfbgfx and the thread-safe version,
libfbgfxmt) are licensed under the GNU LGPLv2 or later, with this exception
to allow linking to it statically:

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
you permission to link this library with independent modules to
produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
license of that module. An independent module is a module which is
not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library,
you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but
you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete
this exception statement from your version.

The FreeBASIC documentation is licensed under the GNU FDL.

Dependencies on third-party libraries:
The FreeBASIC runtime library uses LibFFI to implement the Threadcall
functionality. This means that, by default, FreeBASIC programs will be
linked against LibFFI when using Threadcall. LibFFI is released under
the MIT/Expat license, see doc/libffi-license.txt.
